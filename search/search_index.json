A project can have multiple directories with each of them having 0 or 1 laz.yml files except for the top level which must have 1. Lower-level directories containing a laz.yml file are called sub-projects. Configuration A laz.yml encapsulates the configuration for a directory. It also inherits and/or overrides the configurations found in parent directories within the same project. Inheritance Sub-projects \"inherit\" configuration from parent projects but will also overwrite configuration that they share. Action Actions are commands, functions, or tasks to be run. They can be as simple as a single CLI command or as complicated as a series of CLI commands, Python functions, and plugin actions. CLI commands can be run by Laz without codifying them in a laz.yml. Complicated or common tasks can be codified in a laz.yml as actions. Target All actions must be performed against a target. For example, common targets might be environments such as prod and dev.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"concepts/#concepts","text":"","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"concepts/#project","text":"A Laz project consists of at least one directory containing a laz.yml configuration file.
