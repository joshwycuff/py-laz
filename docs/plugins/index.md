# Plugins

Plugins can be used to extend the functionality of Laz.

A plugin can provide additional hooks and/or actions. During a plugin's hooks, it has access to the
Laz context with which it can manipulate how Laz runs. See the documentation for the built-in
plugins for examples of what plugins can do.

See the [plugin configuration](../advanced/configuration.md#plugins) for how to include a plugin in
a laz.yml configuration file.
